## 📘 C++ PF Mini Projects

This repository is a curated collection of beginner-friendly C++ mini projects developed as part of a Programming Fundamentals (PF) course. Each project is designed to reinforce core programming concepts such as control structures, functions, arrays, file handling, and object-oriented programming (OOP). These console-based applications serve as practical exercises to enhance your understanding of C++.

### 🎯 Key Features

* **Educational Focus**: Tailored for beginners to practice and solidify foundational programming skills.
* **Modular Code Structure**: Each project is self-contained, promoting code readability and maintainability.
* **Practical Applications**: Real-world inspired scenarios to provide context to programming constructs.

### 🚀 Getting Started
